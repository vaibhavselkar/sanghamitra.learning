                  In a world increasingly shaped by technological advancements, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal force driving innovation across industries. The ubiquity of AI in applications ranging from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles underscores its transformative potential. Despite its prominence, AI is not without its challenges. Concerns about privacy, ethical dilemmas, and the displacement of human jobs have prompted calls for pragmatic approaches to its development and implementation.
                </p>
                <p class="text-start">
                  For instance, the revolutionary impact of AI on healthcare cannot be overstated. Machine learning algorithms are redefining diagnostics, enabling early detection of diseases and personalized treatment plans. However, these advancements demand stringent oversight to ensure the accuracy and fairness of AI-driven decisions. Similarly, industries like finance, education, and transportation are grappling with the implications of this technology, striving to balance innovation with accountability.

            <p class="lead">Learning to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words using context clues is an essential reading skill. These strategies will guide you to uncover the meaning of words without a dictionary:</p>
            <h5>What is Vocabulary in Context?</h5>
            <p>Vocabulary in context refers to understanding the meaning of a word based on the surrounding text. This skill helps readers decode unfamiliar words by examining how they are used in a sentence or paragraph.</p>

            <h5><i class="bi bi-search text-primary me-2"></i> Strategy 1: Look for Synonyms or Definitions Nearby</h5>
            <p>Authors often provide clues to a word's meaning in the same sentence or nearby sentences:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Definitions:</strong> Look for phrases like "which means" or "that is" to find a direct explanation.</li>
              <li><strong>Synonyms:</strong> Words with similar meanings might be placed nearby to clarify the term.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategy 2 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-link-45deg text-success me-2"></i> Strategy 2: Use Contrast Clues</h5>
            <p>Sometimes, the author uses contrasting words or ideas to highlight the meaning:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Antonyms:</strong> Words like "but," "however," or "unlike" can signal opposite meanings.</li>
              <li><strong>Comparisons:</strong> Phrases that show differences can help deduce meaning.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategy 3 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-eye text-danger me-2"></i> Strategy 3: Pay Attention to Word Parts</h5>
            <p>Breaking down a word into its components can provide valuable hints:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Prefixes:</strong> Identify common prefixes (e.g., "un-" for not, "pre-" for before).</li>
              <li><strong>Roots:</strong> Look for familiar word roots that suggest the core meaning.</li>
              <li><strong>Suffixes:</strong> Recognize suffixes that indicate word forms (e.g., "-ly" for adverbs, "-tion" for nouns).</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategy 4 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-puzzle text-warning me-2"></i> Strategy 4: Examine Context Clues</h5>
            <p>Analyze the broader context of the sentence or paragraph to infer meaning:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Consider whether the tone is positive, negative, or neutral to guide your interpretation.</li>
              <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Examples or lists in the text often provide hints.</li>
              <li><strong>Situations:</strong> The scenario described can give clues about the word's meaning.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategy 5 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-lightbulb text-info me-2"></i> Strategy 5: Reread and Reflect</h5>
            <p>Sometimes the meaning becomes clear after rereading the sentence or paragraph:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Restatement:</strong> Reread and paraphrase the sentence to see if it clarifies the word's meaning.</li>
              <li><strong>Reassess:</strong> Think about how the word fits the overall idea of the text.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
