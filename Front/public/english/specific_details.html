                <h5 class="text-start">Passage:</h5>
                <p class="text-start">
                Coral reefs, often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," are some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. These underwater structures are formed by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps, which secrete calcium carbonate to build protective skeletons. Coral reefs provide habitats for thousands of marine species, from colorful fish and sea turtles to sharks and sponges. In addition to their ecological importance, coral reefs benefit humans by acting as natural barriers against coastal erosion and storms, protecting shorelines and communities.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-start">
                Despite their significance, coral reefs are under threat from human activities and environmental changes. Rising sea temperatures due to climate change are causing widespread coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, leading to their whitening and potential death. Overfishing disrupts the delicate balance of reef ecosystems, while pollution from agricultural runoff and plastic waste further exacerbates the problem. Coastal development and destructive fishing practices, such as the use of explosives, also contribute to the degradation of these fragile ecosystems.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-start">
                Efforts to protect coral reefs are underway worldwide. Marine protected areas, sustainable fishing regulations, and coral restoration projects aim to mitigate the damage and encourage recovery. Scientists are even exploring innovative techniques, such as breeding heat-resistant corals, to enhance reef survival in warming oceans. By addressing threats like climate change and pollution, these initiatives seek to preserve the invaluable biodiversity and ecological services provided by coral reefs for future generations.

                During the mid-20th century, NASA launched several missions to explore the outer planets. Among these, the Voyager program was particularly successful. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 provided groundbreaking data about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These missions revealed the presence of volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io and confirmed the existence of faint rings around Neptune. Even today, the Voyager spacecraft continue to transmit data as they journey beyond our solar system.

                    "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Electric vehicles (EVs) have transcended their niche beginnings to become central to the global drive towards sustainability. Advances in battery technology, particularly lithium-ion and solid-state innovations, have drastically enhanced energy density, lifespan, and charging efficiency. These developments, coupled with decreasing manufacturing costs, have made EVs increasingly viable for mass-market adoption.</p>",
                    "<p class='passage-paragraph'>A key factor in the adoption of EVs lies in the establishment of robust charging infrastructure. Governments and private entities worldwide are investing heavily in fast-charging networks and smart grid integrations. Such infrastructure not only reduces range anxiety but also facilitates energy storage solutions by enabling vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies, where EVs act as temporary energy reservoirs for the grid during peak demands.</p>",
                    "<p class='passage-paragraph'>However, the widespread deployment of EVs is not without its challenges. The mining and processing of raw materials, such as cobalt and rare earth elements, present significant environmental and ethical dilemmas. Furthermore, while EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, their overall carbon footprint is influenced by the energy mix used for electricity generation. As nations transition to renewable energy sources, the environmental benefits of EVs become increasingly pronounced, but this transition varies significantly across regions.</p>",
                    "<p class='passage-paragraph'>The role of policy cannot be understated in shaping the EV landscape. Incentives such as tax credits, subsidies, and stringent emission regulations have been pivotal in driving EV adoption. Yet, disparities in policy frameworks between developed and developing countries highlight the need for globally coordinated efforts to achieve truly sustainable mobility. As EV technology matures, industry stakeholders must address these multifaceted challenges to ensure an equitable and sustainable future for all.</p>"
