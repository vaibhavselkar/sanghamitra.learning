            <div class="passage bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
                <h5 class="text-start">Passage:</h5>
                <p class="text-start">
                    In the late 19th century, the Industrial Revolution was transforming the economic and social fabric of societies across Europe and North America. Factories began to spring up in urban areas, drawing workers from rural communities in search of better opportunities. While industrialization brought significant advancements in production and technology, it also led to widespread challenges, such as harsh working conditions, child labor, and overcrowded living spaces.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-start">
                    Amid these changes, reformers and writers sought to address the moral and social implications of industrialization. Some, like Charles Dickens in his novels "Oliver Twist" and "Hard Times," vividly depicted the struggles of the working class, exposing the inequities of the industrial system. Others advocated for legislative reforms to improve workers’ rights and safety. For instance, labor unions began to form, pressuring governments to pass laws regulating working hours and conditions in factories. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-start">
                    While critics of industrialization argued that it exploited the most vulnerable members of society, proponents celebrated its ability to lift entire nations out of poverty. They highlighted the ways in which industrialization fostered innovation, increased access to goods, and laid the groundwork for modern infrastructure. The tension between these contrasting views remains a focal point of historical discussions on the Industrial Revolution, offering valuable insights into the costs and benefits of progress.

            <h2>Strategies to Identify the Author's Purpose</h2>
            <p class="lead">Understanding the author’s purpose is key to interpreting a passage. Is the author trying to inform, persuade, entertain, or explain? Use the following strategies to sharpen your skills in identifying the author’s intent:</p>
            <h5>What is the Author's Purpose?</h5>
            <p>The author’s purpose is the primary reason or intent behind writing the passage. It reflects what the author aims to achieve—whether to inform, convince, entertain, or clarify a subject.</p>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategies Section -->
          <h4 class="text-center">Strategies to Identify the Author's Purpose</h4>
  
          <!-- Strategy 1 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-compass text-primary me-2"></i> Strategy 1: Identify the Tone and Language</h5>
            <p>The author’s choice of words, tone, and style can reveal their purpose:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Persuasive Tone:</strong> Uses emotional appeals, strong arguments, or calls to action.</li>
              <li><strong>Informative Tone:</strong> Focuses on providing facts, data, or explanations without bias.</li>
              <li><strong>Entertaining Tone:</strong> Incorporates humor, vivid imagery, or storytelling.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategy 2 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-card-text text-success me-2"></i> Strategy 2: Look for Keywords or Phrases</h5>
            <p>Keywords can often signal the author’s purpose:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Inform:</strong> "To explain," "demonstrates," "provides information."</li>
              <li><strong>Persuade:</strong> "Urge," "advocate for," "encourage action."</li>
              <li><strong>Entertain:</strong> "Describe," "engage," "tell a story."</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategy 3 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-arrows-collapse text-danger me-2"></i> Strategy 3: Consider the Context</h5>
            <p>Think about the broader context in which the passage was written:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is the passage part of a news article? Likely written to inform.</li>
              <li>Is it an advertisement? Likely written to persuade.</li>
              <li>Is it a story or anecdote? Likely written to entertain.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <!-- Strategy 4 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-lightbulb-fill text-warning me-2"></i> Strategy 4: Identify the Central Goal</h5>
            <p>Ask yourself: "What does the author want me to do or think after reading this passage?"</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is the author aiming to change your opinion? Likely persuasive.</li>
              <li>Does the author want to teach you something? Likely informative.</li>
              <li>Is the author aiming to entertain or amuse you? Likely entertaining.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

              <p>
                "Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. Over 8 million tons of plastic waste enter the oceans annually, harming marine life and ecosystems. Governments and organizations worldwide are working to tackle this crisis by implementing recycling programs and banning single-use plastics. However, individual actions are equally important.
