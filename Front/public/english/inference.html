            <!-- Passage -->
            <div class="passage bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
                <h5 class="text-start">Passage:</h5>
                <p class="text-start">
                    In the early 20th century, urbanization and industrialization were transforming cities into bustling centers of commerce and innovation. Amidst this rapid change, public parks began to emerge as vital spaces for recreation and social interaction. City planners of the time believed that parks could improve the quality of urban life by providing a green refuge from the chaos of the industrialized world. They envisioned these areas not just as places of leisure, but as tools for promoting public health, fostering community ties, and encouraging moral behavior.
                </p>
                <p class="text-start">
                    One notable example of this vision was Central Park in New York City. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the 19th century, it became a template for other urban parks around the world. Olmsted believed that exposure to nature could soothe the human mind and counteract the stress of urban life. He deliberately designed meandering pathways and open spaces to invite strolling, contemplation, and social interaction. By providing a space where people from all walks of life could gather, Central Park also embodied ideals of equality and shared public benefit.
                </p>
                <p class="text-start">
                    However, critics of the time argued that these parks often served the interests of the elite more than the general public. Wealthier citizens had easier access to the parks, while working-class neighborhoods were frequently neglected in urban planning. Some historians suggest that the grand vision of parks as tools for social reform was not always realized, and instead, they sometimes mirrored the inequalities of the societies they were meant to uplift.

            <h2>Strategies to Make Inferences</h2>
            <p class="lead">Making inferences involves reading between the lines and drawing conclusions based on what is implied, rather than what is directly stated. These strategies will help you develop this critical reading skill:</p>
            <h5>What is an Inference?</h5>
            <p>An inference is a logical conclusion based on evidence and reasoning. It involves using clues from the text combined with your own knowledge to understand what the author implies but does not state outright.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Strategies Section -->
          <h4 class="text-center">Strategies to Make Inferences</h4>

          <!-- Strategy 1 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-search text-primary me-2"></i> Strategy 1: Use Context Clues</h5>
            <p>Look for clues within the text to uncover implied information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Definitions:</strong> Unfamiliar words or concepts might be explained indirectly.</li>
              <li><strong>Descriptions:</strong> Detailed descriptions of settings, characters, or events can provide hints.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialogue:</strong> What characters say and how they say it can reveal hidden emotions or motives.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Strategy 2 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-link-45deg text-success me-2"></i> Strategy 2: Connect Background Knowledge</h5>
            <p>Combine your prior knowledge with details from the text to draw conclusions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Personal Experiences:</strong> Relate the situation in the text to your own experiences.</li>
              <li><strong>World Knowledge:</strong> Use your understanding of common concepts or situations.</li>
              <li><strong>Genre Expectations:</strong> Consider typical themes or settings in the genre to interpret meaning.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Strategy 3 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-eye text-danger me-2"></i> Strategy 3: Pay Attention to Character Actions and Reactions</h5>
            <p>Characters’ actions often reveal their thoughts and feelings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Body Language:</strong> Physical reactions can indicate emotions not explicitly mentioned.</li>
              <li><strong>Decisions:</strong> Choices made by characters can reflect their priorities or conflicts.</li>
              <li><strong>Interactions:</strong> How characters interact with others can reveal underlying relationships.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Strategy 4 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-puzzle text-warning me-2"></i> Strategy 4: Analyze Cause and Effect</h5>
            <p>Look for cause-and-effect relationships to infer what might happen next or what has already happened:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Immediate Effects:</strong> Identify what occurs directly after an event.</li>
              <li><strong>Long-Term Effects:</strong> Consider potential future outcomes based on the events in the text.</li>
              <li><strong>Hidden Consequences:</strong> Think about consequences that may not be directly mentioned.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Strategy 5 -->
          <div class="strategy-box bg-white p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
            <h5><i class="bi bi-lightbulb text-info me-2"></i> Strategy 5: Look for Implied Meaning</h5>
            <p>Not all information is stated directly. Use subtle clues to uncover implied meanings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Unstated Emotions:</strong> Infer how a character might be feeling based on their actions or words.</li>
              <li><strong>Hidden Relationships:</strong> Identify relationships or connections that are not immediately clear.</li>
              <li><strong>Underlying Themes:</strong> Look for broader messages or themes that the author might be suggesting.</li>
            </ul>

              <h6><i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill text-secondary me-2"></i> Example Passage:</h6>
              <p>
                Emily glanced at the clock for the third time in ten minutes. The room was unusually quiet, save for the faint hum of the air conditioner. She tapped her pen nervously against the desk, her eyes darting to the empty chair across from her. Finally, she sighed and muttered, “I guess he’s not coming.”
              </p>
              <strong>Step-by-Step Strategy to Make Inferences:</strong>
              <ol class="mt-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Use Context Clues:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Emily’s repeated glances at the clock and nervous behavior suggest she is waiting for someone.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Connect Background Knowledge:</strong>
                  <p>
                    People often feel anxious or disappointed when someone they are waiting for doesn’t arrive.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pay Attention to Character Actions and Reactions:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Emily’s sigh and the empty chair indicate she is realizing the person will not show up.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Analyze Cause and Effect:</strong>
                  <p>
                    The absence of the person she was expecting is causing her disappointment.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Look for Implied Meaning:</strong>
                  <p>
                    The passage implies that Emily had an important meeting or appointment, and the absence of the other person affects her.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <strong>What Can We Infer?</strong>
              <p class="mt-3">
                Emily was waiting for someone who didn’t show up, and this has left her feeling disappointed or frustrated.
              </p>
              <strong>Why Is This the Inference?</strong>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>Her actions (glancing at the clock, tapping the pen) indicate nervousness.</li>
                <li>The empty chair suggests she expected someone to be there.</li>
                <li>Her sigh and words imply she has given up waiting.</li>

Amidst this rapid change, public parks began to emerge as vital spaces for recreation and social interaction. City planners of the time believed that parks could improve the quality of urban life by providing a green refuge from the chaos of the industrialized world. They envisioned these areas not just as places of leisure, but as tools for promoting public health, fostering community ties, and encouraging moral behavior.</p>",
              "<p class='passage-paragraph'>One notable example of this vision was Central Park in New York City. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the 19th century, it became a template for other urban parks around the world. Olmsted believed that exposure to nature could soothe the human mind and counteract the stress of urban life. He deliberately designed meandering pathways and open spaces to invite strolling, contemplation, and social interaction. By providing a space where people from all walks of life could gather, Central Park also embodied ideals of equality and shared public benefit.</p>",

                  "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a transformative technological paradigm that extends far beyond simplistic notations of computational problem-solving. At its core, AI encompasses sophisticated systems capable of mimicking human cognitive processes, learning from complex datasets, and generating nuanced responses that challenge traditional boundaries between human and machine intelligence. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has particularly revolutionized our understanding of machine learning capabilities.</p>",
                  "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Large Language Models have emerged as groundbreaking technological artifacts that leverage massive neural networks trained on extensive textual datasets. These models demonstrate unprecedented abilities to understand context, generate human-like text, and perform complex linguistic tasks with remarkable precision. Unlike traditional computational systems, LLMs can synthesize information, recognize intricate patterns, and adapt their outputs based on subtle contextual cues, representing a significant leap in machine learning sophistication.</p>",
                  "<p class='passage-paragraph'>The development of machine learning algorithms has fundamentally transformed multiple domains, from predictive analytics and medical diagnostics to autonomous systems and natural language processing. However, this technological advancement simultaneously raises profound ethical considerations. Questions surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, potential job displacement, and the long-term societal implications of increasingly autonomous systems have become central to contemporary technological discourse.</p>",
                  "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Despite remarkable progress, significant challenges remain in achieving genuine artificial general intelligence. Current AI systems, while impressive, remain fundamentally narrow in their capabilities, excelling in specific domains but lacking the comprehensive adaptability characteristic of human cognition. Researchers continue to explore complex neural network architectures, seeking to bridge the gap between specialized machine learning models and more holistic, flexible intelligent systems.</p>"
