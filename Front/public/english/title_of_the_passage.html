            <div class="passage bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mt-4">
              <h5 class="text-start">Passage:</h5>
              <p class="text-start">
                In the intricate world of ecosystems, the concept of biodiversity plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance and resilience of the environment. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms within a given habitat, ranging from microscopic organisms to towering trees. This diversity is not merely an aesthetic marvel but also a functional necessity, as each species contributes to the stability and productivity of the ecosystem. For instance, forests rich in biodiversity can better withstand natural disasters such as droughts and floods compared to monocultures.
              </p>
              
              <p class="text-start">
                Furthermore, biodiversity is directly linked to ecosystem services—benefits provided by nature that support human life. Pollination, a critical ecosystem service facilitated by insects, ensures the production of crops, while mangrove forests protect coastlines from erosion and storms. Yet, despite its importance, biodiversity is under relentless threat due to human activities such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change. These disruptions can lead to a cascade of consequences, including the collapse of entire ecosystems.
              </p>
              
              <p class="text-start">
                Efforts to mitigate biodiversity loss include conservation strategies like establishing protected areas, enforcing anti-poaching laws, and promoting sustainable agriculture. International agreements, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, aim to create global frameworks for preserving life on Earth. However, achieving meaningful progress requires a collective shift in mindset, recognizing that humanity’s survival is deeply intertwined with the health of natural ecosystems. As the rate of species extinction accelerates, the urgency of addressing biodiversity loss becomes more apparent, prompting both scientists and policymakers to seek innovative solutions.

            <h5><i class="bi bi-list text-primary me-2"></i> Strategy 1: Focus on the Main Idea</h5>
            <p>Identify the central theme or purpose of the passage:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Overall Message:</strong> Determine the key point the author wants to convey.</li>
              <li><strong>Recurring Ideas:</strong> Look for repeated phrases or concepts throughout the text.</li>

The advent of sound in the 1920s revolutionized storytelling, enabling filmmakers to create layered narratives with dialogue and music. The golden age of Hollywood in the mid-20th century established enduring genres like film noir and the Western, which explored complex themes of morality and human conflict.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>The technological leap to digital filmmaking in the late 20th century marked another seismic shift. Directors began to leverage computer-generated imagery (CGI) to craft fantastical worlds, as seen in James Cameron’s *Avatar*. However, this progress also sparked debates about the artistic integrity of traditional filmmaking, with purists lamenting the decline of practical effects.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Moreover, the rise of streaming platforms in the 21st century has redefined cinematic consumption, challenging the dominance of theaters and altering audience expectations. Filmmakers now grapple with balancing visual grandeur with the intimate storytelling formats demanded by smaller screens. Despite these changes, the core purpose of cinema—to evoke emotion and spark imagination—remains unchanged, reflecting humanity’s enduring love for storytelling.</p>"

This theory, first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, posits that continents were once a single landmass, Pangaea, before drifting apart over millions of years due to plate movements. Evidence for this theory includes the jigsaw-like fit of continental coastlines and fossil records spanning disparate regions.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Modern geology reveals that tectonic activity at plate boundaries gives rise to phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain formation. The Pacific Ring of Fire exemplifies this, with its frequent seismic activity resulting from subduction zones where oceanic plates sink beneath continental ones. Additionally, mid-ocean ridges, where plates diverge, act as sites of new crust formation, driving the Earth’s geological renewal.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Despite its acceptance, the theory continues to evolve as satellite technology provides more precise measurements of plate movements. Geologists now explore how these movements influence climate patterns and even evolutionary biology, linking geological forces to the development of life over geological time scales.</p>"

Unlike previous waves of innovation, which were marked by mechanical and industrial advancements, AI focuses on mimicking human cognition through machine learning algorithms and neural networks. AI-driven systems now power diverse applications, from autonomous vehicles to personalized marketing strategies.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>A particularly transformative application of AI is in medicine, where machine learning aids in early disease detection and personalized treatment plans. For example, AI algorithms analyze vast datasets to identify patterns indicative of conditions like cancer, often with greater accuracy than human specialists. Similarly, AI enhances logistical efficiency in industries, optimizing supply chains and reducing resource waste.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Yet, this technological leap raises profound ethical concerns. The integration of AI into decision-making processes often introduces biases, as algorithms reflect the data they are trained on.

Rooted in widespread discontent over social inequality, the revolution sought to dismantle the rigid class hierarchy epitomized by the monarchy and aristocracy. Philosophers like Rousseau and Voltaire had sown the seeds of rebellion, championing ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>The revolution unfolded in phases, each marked by escalating radicalism. The Reign of Terror, led by Robespierre, exemplified the revolution’s darker side, with thousands executed by guillotine under charges of treason. Yet, it also paved the way for enduring democratic principles, inspiring subsequent movements across Europe and beyond.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Napoleon Bonaparte’s rise to power is often seen as a paradoxical outcome, as he consolidated authority while maintaining revolutionary reforms. His Napoleonic Code codified equality before the law, influencing legal systems worldwide.

This revolution began with Max Planck’s proposal in 1900 that energy is quantized, meaning it exists in discrete packets called quanta. Planck’s work laid the foundation for Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle-like behavior of light.</p>",
            "<p class='passage-paragraph'>Key developments followed, such as Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which stated that certain pairs of properties, like position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured with absolute precision. This defied traditional notions of determinism in physics. Additionally, Erwin Schrödinger’s wave equation introduced the concept of wave-particle duality, suggesting that particles exhibit characteristics of both waves and particles depending on how they are observed.</p>",
